<p>Dear Prospective P1 Parents,</p>
<p>On behalf of the School Advisory Committee, I am delighted to welcome
you to Compassvale Primary School’s E-Open House. We are proud to showcase
the incredible work being done to connect hearts and shape minds.</p>
<p>At Compassvale Primary School (CVPS), we focus on both academics and nurturing
the social and emotional well-being of our students. By fostering strong
relationships, we aim to create a sense of belonging and supportive environment
for every child.</p>
<p>Our school is a place where empathy, kindness, and compassion are not
just encouraged but celebrated. We believe that by connecting with one
another on a deeper level, we can make a significant difference in our
students’ lives. I can attest to this through my interactions with the
school leaders, teachers and students.</p>
<p>Educators at CVPS go beyond simply connecting hearts; they also strive
to shape minds by delivering a quality education that challenges and inspires
our students to reach their full potential. Our dedicated teachers work
with unwavering commitment to create engaging and interactive lessons that
ignite a passion for learning in each child. They are also committed to
fostering a lifelong passion for learning in our students, ensuring they
are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary for future success.</p>
<p>As you get introduced to CVPS, I urge you to see the incredible work being
done to connect hearts and shape minds. I invite you to join us on this
journey of growth and development with us. I am confident that you and
your child will have the opportunity to create a unique experience together.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Prospective P1 Parents,</p>
<p>I am thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to you on behalf of the
Compassvale Primary School's Parent Support Group as we celebrate our E-Open
House with the theme "Connecting Hearts, Shaping Minds."</p>
<p>As the Chairperson of the Parent Support Group, I am proud of the strong
bonds we have cultivated within our parent community through various engaging
activities to foster connections, sharing experiences, and offer mutual
support. Our initiatives include parenting workshops led by parents for
parents, exciting parent-child bonding activities and active volunteering
to enhance the school experiences of our Compassvalites. Reflecting on
my own parenting journey and in line with our theme, I would like to encourage
all of us to:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Be Brave and Connect our Hearts with Fellow Parents</strong>:
Embrace the power of vulnerability by sharing challenges and experiences
with one another. Remember, a problem shared is a problem halved, and together,
we can navigate the beautiful chaos of parenthood with support and understanding.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Celebrate and Shape the Minds of Our Children</strong>: Beyond
achievements, it is essential to celebrate our children's efforts and progress.
Recognizing and applauding their hard work and perseverance not only boosts
their confidence but also ignites a passion for continuous learning and
growth. Teaching and supporting our children to have a positive mindset
is like giving them wings to soar above challenges and reach new heights
of success and resilience.</p>
<p>We warmly invite you to join us for our E-Open House on Saturday, 13 July.
We look forward to welcoming you into our compassionate and supportive
family!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Ms Celina Teo</p>
<p>Chairperson, Parent Support Group</p>
