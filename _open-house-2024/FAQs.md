These include:</p>
<p>• Cutting down fat, sugar and salt</p>
<p>• Serving whole grains, fruit and vegetables</p>
<p>• Serving healthy set meals</p>

rice, wholemeal bread, meat and others, vegetables, and fruit. This helps
students to receive the appropriate nutrients necessary for their growing
needs.</p>

how to return their crockery and cutlery to the returning stations after

food and drink from the canteen, a good amount to bring is $2.50 to $3.00
