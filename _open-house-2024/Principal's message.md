<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>The school’s emblem reflects the school’s commitment to the total development
of the child through quality education centered on values and compassion,
instilling the desire for lifelong learning and guiding students as they
strive towards excellence. I feel honoured to be able to join the family
of Compassvalites. Together, we will continue to strengthen that commitment,
building on the good work and legacy of the previous leaders.</p>
<p>Compassvale Primary School (CVPS) was established on 4 January 1999, our
vision inspires us to nurture Thinkers • Leaders • Champions. With the
world getting more complex and fragmented, we need to develop forward thinkers
and leaders who are grounded in values and have the heart to serve and
champion for a good cause for the community and society.</p>
<p>To better prepare our students as active contributors, we aim to ignite
the students’ curiosity and passion for learning through our total curriculum
both within and beyond the classroom. Our school’s Learning for Life Programme
provides Compassvalites many opportunities to discover their talents and
interests. The Applied Learning Programme further develops students’ interest
in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Through these
holistic learning experiences, we seek to develop students’ critical and
inventive thinking, and problem-solving skills to tackle tomorrow’s challenges.</p>
<p>In CVPS, we provide not just a robust and holistic total curriculum, but
an enabling and caring school environment. One where the students feel
that their voices matter and they feel happy, challenged within a safe
and supportive environment.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”, a strong partnership
between school, stakeholders and community is therefore important to reinforce,
enrich, and deepen the students’ learning. This strong nexus of School-Home-Community
partnership will support teachers to help our students succeed in their
endeavours. I look forward to our enduring partnership to nurture our students
to become lifelong learners who strive together for a brighter tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your Partner-In-Education,</p>
<p>Mr Vincent Lee</p>
<p>Principal</p>
