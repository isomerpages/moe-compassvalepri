### **PSG Activities**
Parents who have the students’ interest at heart and passionate about service can consider joining PSGs.

Communication is a two-way process that benefits the children, parents and the school. As a parent, your involvement in your child’s school life sends a clear signal to your child as a form of deep concern for them. This will in turn encourage them to adopt positive attitudes towards learning. With your active involvement, children will be motivated towards better personal development, have better attendance and they tend to participate more actively in learning and other school activities.

By joining a PSG, you will also gain the support from other parents in your parenting endeavor through this network.

Schools benefit as your feedback will help to fine-tune practices that will help students learn and develop. When parents, teachers and the community have a common vision of improving the school, everyone's strengths unite - all for the betterment of our children's education.
