### **Chinese Language**

##### **Chinese Language Department Reading Programme**

Our Chinese Language Department's reading programme aims to nurture a love for reading through engaging and interactive approaches. Through our Primary 1 and Primary 2 SOAR (Spark interest, Open minds, Appreciate cultural roots and Rise as bilingual readers) Reading Programme, teachers bring stories to life during dedicated reading sessions through animated storytelling, creative use of props, and dynamic role-play activities. These immersive experiences not only capture our studentsâ€™ imagination but also strengthen their connection with the Chinese Language. Through this multi-sensory approach, we hope to create a vibrant learning environment and nurture positive reading habits from a young age.<br>

##### **Mother Tongue Language Fortnight**

The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight Programme at Compassvale Primary School is an annual two-week programme that engages students in various fun-filled learning activities to deepen their understanding and appreciation of Chinese Language and culture. Each year, the programme focuses on a different cultural theme, providing a comprehensive exploration and discovery of various facets of traditional culture. The themes include traditional weddings, cuisine, handicrafts, costumes, dance and music. <br>

Throughout the two weeks, a diverse array of activities is carefully curated to offer students authentic and experiential learning opportunities. Over their six years of education at the school, students would have delved into various aspects of Chinese culture and tradition which enables them to not only develop proficiency in the language but also acquire a more holistic and deeper appreciation for the cultural context in which the language thrives.

In essence, the Mother Tongue Language Fortnight at Compassvale Primary School goes beyond the textbook, providing a transformative experience that integrates language learning with a rich tapestry of cultural exploration and discovery. Through this annual event, students emerge with a well-rounded understanding of their mother tongue as a living language deeply rooted in diverse and vibrant traditions. <br>
