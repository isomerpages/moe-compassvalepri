### **Tamil Language**
##### Welcome Activity Card for P1 Students

As the P1 students entered their Tamil classroom for their very first Tamil Language lesson, they were each presented with a welcome card, which lit up their faces with enthusiasm. This specially crafted card was thoughtfully designed by the Tamil Language Department to mark this significant occasion. 
The students enthusiastically colored the cards and affixed the school logo stickers to them. Additionally, they participated in a simple activity that allowed them to express their feelings about their inaugural Tamil lesson. Amid the process of making new friends and adjusting to their unfamiliar surroundings, this activity served as an excellent icebreaker, swiftly bringing everyone together.

Our hope is that, when they revisit this card at the conclusion of their six-year journey at CVPS, it will evoke cherished memories of their very first Tamil language lesson.

##### **P1 Kite Making**
P1 Compassvalites learning the Tamil language had a great time with their families, coming together for a kite-making activity that was both enjoyable and educational. This hands-on experience complemented their classroom learning. Students, parents, and family members were encouraged to converse in Tamil while creating the kites, underlining the importance of using their mother tongue at home to support their language development.

Furthermore, participating in creative projects like this helped students recall the vocabulary learnt in class more effectively. This, in turn, will contribute to their continued progress in conversational skills and their growth as confident learners.

##### **T@P - Tamil at the Park**
Learning at Compassvale Primary School is an exciting and enjoyable experience! The P1 and P2 Tamil students ventured to Sengkang Sculpture Park, conveniently located right next to the school, for a day filled with engaging games and activities as part of T@P (Tamil at the Park) activity.

The P1 students had a blast making their very own kites and flying them in the park, while the P2 students embarked on a thrilling treasure hunt, diligently checking off items from their activity checklist. During the entire session, students made a conscious effort to communicate in Tamil with both their peers and teachers, making it a memorable and language-enriching experience.
