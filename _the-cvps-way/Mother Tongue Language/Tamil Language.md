### **Tamil Language**
#### **Mother Tongue Fortnight**

At Compassvale Primary School, the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight Programme is a vibrant, two-week celebration that brings the Tamil language and culture to life. Each year, students embark on a cultural journey themed around a different tradition; be it the flavors of authentic cuisine, the artistry of handicrafts, or the rhythm of traditional dance and music. Through hands-on activities and immersive experiences, they don’t just learn about the culture, they live it.

#### **Pongal Festival**
In the bright and cheerful Tamil classroom of Compassvale Primary School, students are buzzing with excitement. They’re learning all about Pongal, the festival of thanks and joy! As their teacher shares stories about sunny fields, hardworking farmers, and happy cattle, the children imagine the golden rice plants swaying in the wind. They learn that Pongal is celebrated over four joyful days in January, marking the start of the Tamil month Thai; a time filled with good luck. As the students listen, draw, and even act out the celebrations, they realise Pongal isn’t just something far away. It’s a beautiful part of their own culture, coming alive right in their Tamil classroom.

#### **Little Explorers,  Big Discoveries**
In the lively world of the Primary 1 and 2 Tamil classroom, learning feels more like playtime! Little hands are busy clapping to Tamil rhymes, matching colourful picture cards to words, and forming Tamil letters with playdough and sand trays. With every giggle and cheerful chant, the children are not just having fun; they’re learning new words, sounds, and sentences in Tamil! Through hands-on activities like role-play, drawing, singing, and storytelling, Tamil becomes something they can see, hear, touch, and even act out. These playful moments make it easier for young minds to remember what they learn, and they begin to feel proud of speaking and understanding their mother tongue. For these young learners, Tamil isn’t just a subject. It’s an exciting adventure filled with laughter, colour, and creativity!<br>
