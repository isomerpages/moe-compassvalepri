### **Tamil Language**
#### **Mother Tongue Fortnight**

At Compassvale Primary School, the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight Programme is a vibrant, two-week celebration that brings the Tamil language and culture to life. Each year, students embark on a cultural journey themed around a different tradition; be it the flavors of authentic cuisine, the artistry of handicrafts, or the rhythm of traditional dance and music. Through hands-on activities and immersive experiences, they donâ€™t just learn about the culture, they live it.

#### **P1 Kite Making**
P1 Compassvalites learning the Tamil language had a great time with their families, coming together for a kite-making activity that was both enjoyable and educational. This hands-on experience complemented their classroom learning. Students, parents, and family members were encouraged to converse in Tamil while creating the kites, underlining the importance of using their mother tongue at home to support their language development.

Furthermore, participating in creative projects like this helped students recall the vocabulary learnt in class more effectively. This, in turn, will contribute to their continued progress in conversational skills and their growth as confident learners.

#### **T@P - Tamil at the Park**
Learning at Compassvale Primary School is an exciting and enjoyable experience! The P1 and P2 Tamil students ventured to Sengkang Sculpture Park, conveniently located right next to the school, for a day filled with engaging games and activities as part of T@P (Tamil at the Park) activity.

The P1 students had a blast making their very own kites and flying them in the park, while the P2 students embarked on a thrilling treasure hunt, diligently checking off items from their activity checklist. During the entire session, students made a conscious effort to communicate in Tamil with both their peers and teachers, making it a memorable and language-enriching experience.
