### **Tamil Language**
#### **Mother Tongue Fortnight**

At Compassvale Primary School, the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight Programme is a vibrant, two-week celebration that brings the Tamil language and culture to life. Each year, students embark on a cultural journey themed around a different tradition; be it the flavors of authentic cuisine, the artistry of handicrafts, or the rhythm of traditional dance and music. Through hands-on activities and immersive experiences, they don’t just learn about the culture, they live it.

#### **Pongal Festival**
In the bright and cheerful Tamil classroom of Compassvale Primary School, students are buzzing with excitement. They’re learning all about Pongal, the festival of thanks and joy! As their teacher shares stories about sunny fields, hardworking farmers, and happy cattle, the children imagine the golden rice plants swaying in the wind. They learn that Pongal is celebrated over four joyful days in January, marking the start of the Tamil month Thai; a time filled with good luck. As the students listen, draw, and even act out the celebrations, they realise Pongal isn’t just something far away. It’s a beautiful part of their own culture, coming alive right in their Tamil classroom.

#### **T@P - Tamil at the Park**
Learning at Compassvale Primary School is an exciting and enjoyable experience! The P1 and P2 Tamil students ventured to Sengkang Sculpture Park, conveniently located right next to the school, for a day filled with engaging games and activities as part of T@P (Tamil at the Park) activity.

The P1 students had a blast making their very own kites and flying them in the park, while the P2 students embarked on a thrilling treasure hunt, diligently checking off items from their activity checklist. During the entire session, students made a conscious effort to communicate in Tamil with both their peers and teachers, making it a memorable and language-enriching experience.
