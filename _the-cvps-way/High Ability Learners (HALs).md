<h3><strong>Programmes for High-Ability Learners in CVPS (HAL)</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>At Compassvale Primary School, we offer opportunities designed to challenge
and engage high-ability learners. These students can participate in enrichment
programmes organized by various departments to cultivate their interests
and talents.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>English Department</strong></h4>
<p><strong>STRETCH Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Let’s STRETCH – <strong>STR</strong>ive, <strong>E</strong>n<strong>T</strong>huse, <strong>C</strong>reate
and <strong>H</strong>one!</p>
<p>The English Language STRETCH programme aims to harness our students’ potential
and develop them into efficient users of the language. It provides an excellent
opportunity for our students to extend their learning and deepen their
linguistic skills. Through collaborative learning, our students apply inter-disciplinary
knowledge to compose and illustrate value-centric stories “for Compassvalites,
by Compassvalites”.</p>
<p>The programme is designed to develop our students’ critical and inventive
thinking skills. Students use the linguistic skills acquired to create
and represent their ideas. In the process, they develop into effective
and empathetic communicators. Taking ownership of their learning, students
take pride in their published work which will be shared with the school.</p>
