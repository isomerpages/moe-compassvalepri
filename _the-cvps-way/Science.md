### **Science**
At Compassvale Primary School, we believe every child can think like a scientist and champion scientific causes. Every child comes to school curious about the world they live in and the daily scientific phenomenon they observe around them.

The goals of the Science Department are to encourage students to<br>
1\. Think like a Scientist<br>
2\. Lead in science discoveries<br>
3\. Champion scientific causes

##### **Think like a Scientist**
By cultivating a scientific mindset, students not only develop a deeper understanding of the natural world but also acquire valuable skills that can be applied across various disciplines. 

The learning of Science takes place beyond the classrooms where students explore the Ecological Garden, Fern Garden and the Herbs and Spices Gardens. The out-of-the classroom experiences provide students with an opportunity to question what they observe and find ways to derive answers by careful observations using the scientific method.

Moving the students forward to be critical thinkers and develop the future skills necessary for students to engage in the more complex world, students are encouraged to draw links to what they learn and observe to real-life phenomenon. This is done through the use of the school’s Makerspace where elements of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Aesthetics and Maths) are used for students to apply what they learn to authentic scenarios such as forensics and architecture.

The out-of-the-classroom learning enables students to solve real-life problems, discover and deepen their learning of Science. Hands-on activities and projects are designed to encourage our students to overcome challenges, innovate and embark on a journey of knowledge construction.

Ultimately, thinking like a scientist nurtures a sense of wonder and fosters a lifelong love for learning.


##### **Lead in Science Discoveries**
In the science classrooms, teachers adopt an inquiry approach for students to co-construct knowledge with their teachers and peers.&nbsp;

By empowering students to lead in science discoveries, students become active participants in the scientific community, contributing to the advancement of knowledge and innovation. They develop a passion for science and a lifelong love for learning, paving the way for future scientific breakthroughs and discoveries.

##### **Fun with Science**
Our Fun with Science programme designed for P1 and P2 students allows them to have their first-hand experience in Science. Our students are able to identify the application of science in their many daily life experiences making learning meaningful.

##### **Creative Science Toy Making**
By combining creativity and science, Creative Science Toy Making sparks curiosity, nurtures a love for learning, and inspires students to explore the wonders of the scientific world. Students engage in toy-making to apply what they have learnt in the science classroom with the right scientific attitudes.   

Unleashing their creativity and bringing their ideas to life, students engage in Design Thinking, by going through many phases in the designing of their toys and learnt how productive failure leads to desirable outcomes.

#### **Champion Scientific Causes**
The school’s environmental education programme allows our students to explore environmental related issues, engage in decision-making, and take actions to conserve and protect the environment. Students champion the green habits under the guidance of teachers and the programme includes green habit practices, sharing during assembly and recess activities. 

This initiative not only raises awareness about scientific issues but also fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills. By taking actions and championing scientific causes such as 30 by 30 – Our Food Future, students develop a sense of empathy, environmental stewardship, and a commitment to making a positive impact on the world.

##### **Championing 4Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse**
By championing the 4Rs, students develop a sense of responsibility, environmental stewardship, and a commitment to sustainable living. 

Our Science Leaders from Primary 3 to 6 champion the school’s recycling efforts and encourage the habit of recycling of daily common items that students would unknowingly throw away. From used paper to drink cartons, our Science Leaders are the subject-matter experts when it comes to which items to recycle and not recycle, and which items to reuse instead of recycling. They become advocates for a greener future, inspiring others to adopt eco-friendly practices and make a positive impact on the planet.

##### **Championing Water Conservation**
In 2020, the school procured and built a rainwater harvester near the canteen with the intent of conserving the use of potable drinking water for cleaning and landscaping purposes such as watering the plants and the school field. The rainwater harvester collects rainwater that falls on our roof and diverts much of that water into a tank that stores that rainwater for use later. In addition, this system models our school’s vision of thinking, leading and championing innovative solutions that care for the environment. Students are able to witness the application of science and other disciplines to form innovative solutions.

By championing water conservation, students develop a sense of responsibility, empathy, and environmental stewardship. They become advocates for sustainable water usage, inspiring others to adopt water-saving practices and contribute to the preservation of this vital resource.
