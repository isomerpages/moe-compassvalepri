The ALP programme helps the students to develop students’ interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The programme also develops students’ critical thinking, problem solving skills, deepening their understanding of Science literacy and apply mathematical skills using authentic data and information.&nbsp;

The P3 to P6 students in CVPS go through a spiral curriculum of Micro:bit that enables them to integrate the different disciplines into a cohesive learning paradigm to design their own products and solve real-world problems.
