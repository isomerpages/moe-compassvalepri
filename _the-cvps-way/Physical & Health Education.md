#### **Let's Move**
During recess, students are encouraged to take part in various forms of recess play to explore, problem-solve, socialise and keep themselves active on a daily basis, participating in activities they enjoy.

At various locations in school, students learn to make new friends and participate in games, challenges or skill practice stations. As part of Let’s Move, students get an opportunity to demonstrate their core values. They learn to care for the equipment&nbsp;provided for them, practise turn-taking and follow the lead of their Sports Champions to ensure everyone is able to have an enjoyable recess in a vibrant and safe environment.

#### **Outdoor Camp**
All P5 students attend an adventure camp for 3 days and 2 nights. Through exposure to the various outdoor elements, students develop their character and are given numerous opportunities to lead their teams and champion their ideas. They work with each other to solve problems and overcome obstacles, constantly thinking about doing things better and yet still caring for each other. In the camp, every activity is planned such that students will need to demonstrate&nbsp; school core values.
