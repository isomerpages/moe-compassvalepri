#### **Let's Move**
During recess, our vibrant play programme transforms break time into opportunities for growth and enjoyment. Students are encouraged to explore diverse activities that keep them physically active while developing essential life skills. At various designated zones throughout the school, students engage in games, challenges, and skill-building stations that foster both individual development and social connections.

Through these purposeful activities, students demonstrate and strengthen their core values in action. They learn valuable lessons in responsibility by caring for shared equipment, develop patience through turn-taking, and follow the guidance of our dedicated Sports Champions. This structured yet flexible approach ensures every student has the opportunity to participate in activities they enjoy while maintaining a safe and inclusive environment.

Through these daily interactions, students naturally develop problem-solving abilities, build new friendships, and create a lively community atmosphere that makes recess a highlight of their school day.

#### **Outdoor Camp**
Our 3 days 2 nights adventure camp is a transformative experience for Primary 5 students, taking them beyond classroom walls into the exciting realm of outdoor education. Set against nature's backdrop, students embark on challenging activities that push their boundaries and foster personal growth.

The carefully crafted programme provides numerous opportunities for students to step into leadership roles, voice their ideas, and work collaboratively to overcome obstacles. Whether navigating team challenges or tackling individual tasks, students learn to think creatively, adapt to new situations, and support one another through every challenge.

Each activity is thoughtfully designed to bring our school's core values to life. As students face and conquer various challenges together, they develop resilience, strengthen their problem-solving abilities, and forge deeper bonds with their peers. This immersive experience creates lasting memories while building character and confidence that extends well beyond the campsite.
