### **Physical &amp; Health Education**
#### **Sports Carnival**
Compassvalites engage in a day of sporting events, station games and skills tests. It is a day of joyful competition and students learn to compete to their best of abilities, think of ways to overcome challenges individually or collaboratively and take turns to lead their teams to victory.

#### **Let's Move**
During recess, students are encouraged to take part in various forms of recess play to explore, problem-solve, socialise and keep themselves active on a daily basis, participating in activities they enjoy.

At various locations in school, students learn to make new friends and participate in games, challenges or skill practice stations. As part of Let’s Move, students get an opportunity to demonstrate their core values. They learn to care for the equipment&nbsp;provided for them, practise turn-taking and follow the lead of their Sports Champions to ensure everyone is able to have an enjoyable recess in a vibrant and safe environment.

#### **Outdoor Camp**
All P5 students attend an adventure camp for 3 days and 2 nights. Through exposure to the various outdoor elements, students develop their character and are given numerous opportunities to lead their teams and champion their ideas. They work with each other to solve problems and overcome obstacles, constantly thinking about doing things better and yet still caring for each other. In the camp, every activity is planned such that students will need to demonstrate&nbsp; school core values.

#### **SwimSafer Program**
SwimSafer is a national water safety program developed to raise the standard of swimming proficiency in Singapore. All Primary 3 students would be given the opportunity to attend and experience this program.&nbsp;The&nbsp;aim is to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills to children to minimize drowning incidences in a fun manner.

#### **Post PSLE Interclass Games**
Primary 6 students pit their skills and tactics against one another during the interclass games that include sports such as Ultimate Frisbee, Football, Basketball and Captain’s Ball. Teachers join in the fun too in the teachers-students match. Students practise their core values while they compete to their best of abilities. It is also an excellent opportunity for them to unwind after the examinations.

#### **Active Youth Recharge Programme**
Selected students are invited to enrol in a programme where they get to learn to play exciting sports or engage in physically fun activities and learn more about healthy eating. All the sessions require the students to think positive and be champions of their own health. They are taught how to lead a healthier lifestyle beyond school.
