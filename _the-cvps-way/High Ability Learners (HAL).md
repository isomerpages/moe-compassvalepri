### **Programmes for High-Ability Learners in CVPS (HAL)**
At Compassvale Primary School, we offer opportunities designed to challenge and engage high-ability learners. These students can participate in enrichment programmes organized by various departments to cultivate their interests and talents.

####  **English Department**
**STRETCH Programme** <br>
Let’s STRETCH – **STR**ive, **E**n**T**huse, **C**reate and **H**one!

The English Language STRETCH programme aims to harness our students’ potential and develop them into efficient users of the language. It provides an excellent opportunity for our students to extend their learning and deepen their linguistic skills. Through collaborative learning, our students apply inter-disciplinary knowledge to compose and illustrate value-centric stories “for Compassvalites, by Compassvalites”.

The programme is designed to develop our students’ critical and inventive thinking skills. Students use the linguistic skills acquired to create and represent their ideas. In the process, they develop into effective and empathetic communicators. Taking ownership of their learning, students take pride in their published work which will be shared with the school.

Are you game enough for more? Then we have the **Mathematics Olympiad** Training and Competition for you! The Mathematics Olympiad programme in CVPS aims to stretch students who are more mathematically inclined from Primary 4 to Primary 6.

Selected Primary 4 to Primary 6 students will also represent the school to take part in the Mathematics Olympiad Competitions at the national level.

**Excellence 2000 E2K Mathematics Programme** 

Who knew getting the wrong answers could bring tears of joy? P4 and P5 Compassvalites are taking a step further in honing their Mathematics competency through the E2K programme.

The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop cognitive abilities of independent learning, higher order thinking and creativity in students who are advanced in the learning of the subject. This group of students will also learn to create and make connections of the mathematical concepts that they have acquired into real life applications. 

This empowers and stretches the students’ mathematical skills, fosters abilities and strengthens their confidence in the subject. Furthermore, this programme is taught by E2K-trained teachers so that targeted coaching can reinforce students' perception of self as an independent and mature learner and investigator.
