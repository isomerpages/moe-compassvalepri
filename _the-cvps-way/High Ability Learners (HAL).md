### **Programmes for High-Ability Learners in CVPS (HAL)**
At Compassvale Primary School, we offer opportunities designed to challenge and engage high-ability learners. These students can participate in enrichment programmes organized by various departments to cultivate their interests and talents.

####  **English Department**
**STRETCH Programme**
Let’s STRETCH – **STR**ive, **E**n**T**huse, **C**reate and **H**one!

The English Language STRETCH programme aims to harness our students’ potential and develop them into efficient users of the language. It provides an excellent opportunity for our students to extend their learning and deepen their linguistic skills. Through collaborative learning, our students apply inter-disciplinary knowledge to compose and illustrate value-centric stories “for Compassvalites, by Compassvalites”.

The programme is designed to develop our students’ critical and inventive thinking skills. Students use the linguistic skills acquired to create and represent their ideas. In the process, they develop into effective and empathetic communicators. Taking ownership of their learning, students take pride in their published work which will be shared with the school.

**Excellence 2000 E2K Mathematics Programme** 

P4 and P5 Compassvalites are taking a step further in their Mathematics competency through the E2K programme.

The E2K Mathematics Programme aims to develop cognitive abilities of independent learning, higher order thinking and creativity in students who are advanced in the learning of the subject. This group of students will also learn to create and make connections of the mathematical concepts that they have acquired into real life applications at upper primary level. 

This empowers and stretches the students’ mathematical skills, fosters abilities, and strengthens their confidence in the subject. Furthermore, this programme is taught by E2K-trained teachers so that targeted coaching can reinforce students' perception of self as an independent and mature learner and investigator.

#### **Science Department**
**Excellence 2000 E2k Science Programme** 

The programme aims to provide students with opportunities to delve deeper into scientific concepts and develop critical thinking skills.

Through a combination of hands-on experiments, research projects, and interactive discussions, students are challenged to think beyond the textbook and explore real-world applications of scientific principles. The programme encourages students to ask probing questions, make connections between different scientific disciplines, and develop a deeper understanding of complex scientific phenomena. By engaging in collaborative and inquiry-based learning, students develop problem-solving abilities, analytical thinking, and effective communication skills.

#### **Mother Tongue Department**
##### **Higher Mother Curriculum from P3 to P6**

To enhance the learning of Mother Tongue Languages from an early age, our school offers Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) classes for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6. Primary 2 students who exhibit strong ability and interest in a Mother Tongue Language will be invited to participate in a two-year HMTL curriculum, starting with Primary 3. Additionally, Primary 4 students who demonstrate a keen interest and aptitude for their Mother Tongue Language at a higher level can opt to take a Higher Mother Tongue Language starting in Primary 5. 

The HMTL curriculum is conducted weekly outside of school hours, and it includes exposure to literary texts, higher order thinking exercises, and creative, engaging activities and games.
