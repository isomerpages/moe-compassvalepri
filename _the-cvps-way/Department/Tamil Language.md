### **Tamil Language**
Lessons come alive and it’s full of fun over at Compassvale Primary School! The P1 & P2 Tamil students went to the Sengkang Sculpture Park situated just beside the school for fun games and activities as part of T@P (Tamil at the Park). The P1 students made their own kites and flew them at the park. The P2 students had a treasure hunt while striking off the lists of things they should spot on their activity fun sheet. The students tried to take conscious efforts to communicate in Tamil with their peers and teachers throughout the session.
