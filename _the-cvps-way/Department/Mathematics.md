### **Mathematics**
#### **Our Learning Approach**
Our teaching philosophy is one with the belief that every child is unique. Here in Compassvale Primary School, we believe that every child is a Thinker, Leader and Champion. Hence, we cater to a variety of approaches so that meaningful and enjoyable learning could take place for every child. We facilitate the acquisition of skills and knowledge through a variety of activities and tools such as the use of **concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA)** activities from Primary One and infusing **Info-Communication Technology (ICT)** in the teaching and learning of Mathematics. The curriculum is progressive and spiral so that learning would engage and accompany each child in these 6 years, bringing out the joy of learning.

##### **Primary 1 and 2**
As each child begins their journey in learning Mathematics with us, they will go through a fun and engaging way through varied activities in our key programmes.The **Mathematics Big Book Reading Programme**  helps our younger students to develop interest and motivation in learning Mathematics. This programme uses Math stories and role plays. 

Plenty of opportunities for hands-on and activity-based learning are provided through the use of our **Sustained Support for Mathematics (SSM)**. Compassvalites are provided with manipulatives to visualize the concepts in a concrete way. They will also be exposed to our in-house programme, **HATS in MATHS**. HATS, short for Heuristics and Thinking Skills, aims to develop their thinking skills and equip them with different strategies, which in turn develops our thinkers’ problem-solving skills --- a crucial life skill. 

In addition, the enhanced **Learning Support Programme for Mathematics (LSM)** supports selected Primary 1 and 2 children to strengthen their foundation in Mathematics to ensure that every child is well-equipped to advance in their journey in Mathematics.

Learning does not end in the classroom. Your child gets to participate in the **Mathematics Games** which are conducted during recess and lunch breaks. These games had been carefully selected by the teachers to reinforce mathematical skills that have been taught in the classroom. The games excite the children to explore learning through play with their peers. This stimulates skills which include critical thinking, spatial visualisation and analysis of relationships. Students would foster a love for Mathematics in an engaging environment where creativity is promoted.
