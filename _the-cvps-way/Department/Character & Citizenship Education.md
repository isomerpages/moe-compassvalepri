### **Character & Citizenship Education**
The school believes that only through holistic education can a child be educated both academically as well as in character. In line with the school’s thrust of developing character, the Character & Citizenship Education Department aims to educate the students holistically and fulfil the school’s mission in nurturing compassionate leaders excelling in service of the community and Singapore. The focus for the department is to inculcate core values in students, equip them with life skills and develop their leadership qualities.The following programmes and activities are carried out to develop our students holistically.

#### **Core Values Corner**
To immerse our students in a values rich environment, every class will set up a core values corner where students put up their works pertaining to our school values R3ICH. Students are encouraged to pen their reflections after attending the assembly talk on core values.

#### **Values In Action (VIA)**
VIA are learning experiences that support students' development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. We believe through taking action, our students will gain valuable insights, and that “Values in Action” will help each and every student grow as a person and as a leader.

#### **Buddy Matching Exercise**
During the first week of school, the P6 students are ‘buddies’ to the Primary 1 students during recess to help the younger ones familiarize with the school setting so that they can adjust to a new environment. This exercise also helps to instil  the value of care in the P6 students.

#### **Student Leadership**
We believe that every student has the potential to become a student leader. Aligning to the school’s vision ‘Thinkers, Leaders, Champions’, we seek to develop our students to become effective leaders and guide them to bring out the best in themselves. Students with consistent performance will be nominated for school-wide leadership roles such as Prefects, NE Champions, Sports Champions  and Cyber Wellness Champions to Lead Peers.  In their respective roles, student leaders are given multiple platforms and ample opportunities to lead and serve.The Student Council consists of the prefects, CCA Leaders and Sports Champions who are shortlisted based on their exemplary character and strengths to plan, organise and lead in school activities. The Student Council leads the whole student body by organizing, managing and carrying out school programmes, initiating activities to improve the school community and representing the school for external activities. They will be tasked to carry out meaningful projects to serve and Lead School.

##### **Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)**
FTGP is one of the initiatives rolled out as part of CCE to primary schools for all levels. The rationale for having FTGP is to provide protected time for form teachers to build positive relationships with their students. FTGP consists of interactive class activities and life skills lessons that aim to equip students with SE competencies. In Compassvale Primary, we believe in the importance of fostering good relationships with our students and social emotional learning.
