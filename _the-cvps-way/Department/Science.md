### **Science**
At Compassvale Primary School, we believe every child can think like a scientist and champion scientific causes. Every child comes to school curious about the world they live in and the daily scientific phenomenon they observe around them.

The goals of the Science Department are to encourage students to<br>
1\. Think like a Scientist<br>
2\. Lead in science discoveries<br>
3\. Champion scientific causes

##### **Think like a Scientist**
The learning of Science takes place beyond the classrooms where students explore the Ecological Garden, Fern Garden and the Herbs and Spices Gardens. The out-of-the classroom experiences provide students with an opportunity to question what they observe and find ways to derive answers by careful observations using the scientific method. 

Moving the students forward to be critical thinkers and develop the future skills necessary for students to engage in the more complex world, students are encouraged to draw links to what they learn and observe to real-life phenomenon. This is done through the use of the school's Makerspace where elements of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Aesthetics and Maths) are used for students to apply what they learn to authentic scenarios such as forensics and architecture. 

The out-of-the-classroom learning enables students to solving real-life problems, discover and deepen their learning of Science. Hands-on activities and projects are designed to encourage our students to  overcome challenges, to innovate and embark on a journey of knowledge construction.

##### **Lead in Science Discoveries**
In the science classrooms, teachers adopt an inquiry approach for students to co-construct knowledge with their teachers and peers. 

This creates a sense of ownership among students for their learning. Teachers continue to provide students with authentic experiences where students are able to lead in learning and experience the ‘Eureka’ moment as a science learner.

##### **Fun with Science**
Our Fun with Science programme designed for P1 and P2 students allows them to have their first-hand experience in Science. Our students are able to identify the application of science in their many daily life experiences making learning meaningful.
