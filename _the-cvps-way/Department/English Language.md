### **English Language**

##### **Confident and Effective English Learners**
The CVPS English Language Programme aims to nurture Compassvalites’ love for the language and develop them into Thinkers, Leaders and Champions with a systematic and spiral approach to teaching and learning. This is done by providing a rich, authentic and meaningful language experience for all our Compassvalites. Through the use of the STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) approach, we build in our students a strong foundation of language learning in four main areas – listening, speaking, reading and writing.

##### **Reading Programme**
The department strives to spark our students’ joy in reading by developing their capacity and interest in reading. Students learn to read with the STELLAR approach, Learning Support Programme (LSP), Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) and School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR). We help students explore their interests and interact with the book contents through activities in our in-house “My Joyful Reading Journey” series, the online reading portal (MyON) and partnership with National Library Board (NLB). In addition, our reading ambassadors are trained to set up book displays and make book recommendations to their peers.

#####  **Literature in Curriculum**
The language ability of proficient readers are stretched through discussion of literary devices and writing techniques used in quality and authentic children's literature. This not only promotes exploratory talk, but also helps our middle and upper primary students to develop a broader worldview. It also cultivates critical appreciation of human and social conditions as presented by the themes in the chosen children literature.
