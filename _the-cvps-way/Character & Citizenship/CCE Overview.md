### **CCE Overview**
The school believes that only through holistic education can a child be educated both academically as well as in character. In line with the school’s thrust of developing character, the Character & Citizenship Education Department aims to educate the students holistically and fulfil the school’s mission in nurturing compassionate leaders excelling in service of the community and Singapore. 

**CCE@CVPS** adopts Head-Heart-Hands approach.

| **Head** | **Heart** | **Hands** |

| Compassvalites acquire knowledge on values, citizenship and SEL competencies through explicit teaching and experiential programmes. | Compassvalites internalise the values and knowledge learnt and translate them into thoughts, words and actions to better self, friends, family and community.     | Compassvalites impact themselves and others positively by serving the school and the community; contributing to society. |
