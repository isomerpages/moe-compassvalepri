### **National Education**
CVPS commemorates the 4 core NE events (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day) which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore’s history. Through these NE commemorative days, students learn important lessons from significant moments in Singapore history, understand the importance of our nation’s friendship ties with other countries, and reflect on they can apply their learning and contribute as active citizens.
