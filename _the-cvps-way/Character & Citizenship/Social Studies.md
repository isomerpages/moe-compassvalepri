### **Social Studies Overview**
Authentic learning experience forms part of the teaching and learning of Social Studies. As we adapt to the current situation, students are still able to immerse themselves in fun and meaningful learning without stepping out of their classrooms. This was done through the use of technology and arts and crafts. These experiences strengthen studentsâ€™ understanding and appreciation of Singapore and enable them to make connections between knowledge learnt with real, authentic experiences.
