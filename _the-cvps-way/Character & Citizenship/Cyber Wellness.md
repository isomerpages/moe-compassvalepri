### **Cyber Wellness**
The aim of the Cyber Wellness programme is to develop our students to be discerning and responsible ICT users who are able to protect themselves and be responsible for their well-being in the cyberspace.

The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students on Cyber Wellness.  This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense, Think and Act.

Platforms are given to our Cyber Wellness Champions to learn and advocate  actions or messages on Cyber Wellness with their peers, friends and family.

#### **Cyber Wellness Activities**
Our Cyber Wellness Champions take part in the yearly National CW Advocacy Challenge (NCAC) organised by Crescent Girls’ School (CGS). Our CW champions designed games, presented to the school on strategies and tips to detect fake news and even shared nuggets of cyber information to their peers and parents during TDD, Cyber Wellness week and Open House day. 

Students also attend workshops on current cyber trends to equip them with relevant knowledge and skills. This would empower them to be able to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace.
