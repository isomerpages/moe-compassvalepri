### **CCE Curriculum**

#### **CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) Lessons**
Our structured CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP) curriculum equips students with social emotional competencies and school values and provide quality interaction time between form teachers and students in a safe and positive learning environment.

#### **CCE Mother Tongue (MT) Lessons**
CCE lessons are taught in Mother Tongue languages (MTL). For students who take the non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL) as their Mother Tongue and for those exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English. CCE MT teachers use cultural stories, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language to teach moral values and perspective taking.

#### **CCE Corner**
To immerse our students in a values rich environment, every class has a core values corner in the classroom where values posters and studentsâ€™ works pertaining to the school values are showcased.
