### **Education &amp; Career Guidance**
In CVPS, we aim to provide foundational knowledge, skills, and support to introduce our students to various possibilities, instill a sense of curiosity and cultivate a positive attitude towards learning. 

#### **Career Fair**
E-Career lessons on SLS were shared with students prior to expose them to the different careers available. We also invite guest speakers from our community partners, alumni and parents. students get to listen to the rich sharing on the nature of our speakersâ€™ work and challenges they faced. Through the career talks, students will gain a better understanding on the different careers available and scope of work. This is done with the hope to excite and motivate our students in their learning.

#### **MySkillsFuture Portal for Upper Primary**
MySkillsFuture student portal allows students to learn about key features that enable them to explore the different education options and schools available. This portal is designed to raise their awareness and plan their educational pathways so that they can embark on the next level of their education as they transit to secondary schools.
