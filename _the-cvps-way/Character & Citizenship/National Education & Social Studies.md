### **National Education &amp; Social Studies**
##### **National Education**
Compassvale Primary School commemorates the 4 core NE events which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore's history. The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.

#### **NE Events**
##### **Total Defence Day**
The school commemorates Total Defence Day on 15 February annually to mark Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in 1942. Coincidentally, it was also the first day of the Lunar New Year. Through a combined celebration of the Lunar New Year and Total Defence Day, students learn about the hardships our forefathers had to go through in order for us&nbsp; to celebrate Lunar New Year peacefully today.

##### **International Friendship Day**
As part of an immersive experience, the graduating cohort is also treated to a trip to one of the selected UNESCO sites in ASEAN - virtually \- through the use of green screen!

##### **National Day Observance Ceremony**
National Day marks our separation from Malaysia, and our emergence as an independent country in the community of nations. Since 1998, a National Day Observance Ceremony was introduced in schools in Singapore. This Ceremony aims to bring to the students a greater sense of the historical importance and solemnity of National Day.

##### **Social Studies**
Authentic learning experience forms part of the teaching and learning of Social Studies. As we adapt to the current situation, students are still able to immerse themselves in fun and meaningful learning without stepping out of their classrooms. This was done through the use of technology and arts and crafts. These experiences strengthen students’ understanding and appreciation of Singapore and enable them to make connections between knowledge learnt with real, authentic experiences.

Social Studies at the primary level aims to inculcate in the students from a very early age a sense of belonging to the community and country and cultivate the right instincts for reinforcing social cohesion. Incorporating the four disciplines of History, Geography, Sociology and Economics, the subject enables students to have a better understanding of their social world in the 21st century which will help them to participate effectively in the society and environment in which they live.&nbsp;

Although Social Studies is a non-examination subject for all levels, assessment will still be necessary to monitor the students' progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the Social Studies instructional programme. We gather and provide feedback on the students' learning through a variety of both formal and non-formal modes of assessment.

##### **Current News Affairs (CNA)**
Students connect what they have learnt in Social Studies to real, world issues such as environmental protection and regional/international affairs (ASEAN and ancient civilisations) through discussions. We also infuse contemporary issues discussion into English lessons and NE Events to develop active citizenry and critical thinking among students, helping them to understand the multiple perspectives on current affairs.
