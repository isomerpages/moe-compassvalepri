Our Art Curriculum nurtures creativity, self-expression, and critical thinking through hands-on exploration of various art forms. Integrated within a holistic aesthetics programme, it aims to spark a lifelong passion for the Arts by providing meaningful and progressive learning experiences that build confidence and collaboration.

To enhance the art learning experience at each level, Compassvalites participate in engaging and level-specific programmes:
* **Primary 3** - Sculpture Walk
* **Primary 4** - Watercolour Painting &amp; Museum-Based Learning
* **Primary 5** - Manga Drawing
* **Primary 6** - Portrait Drawing

These signature programmes not only enrich Compassvalites’ artistic skills but also deepen their cultural understanding and visual literacy, empowering them to become confident and expressive individuals.

##### **Music Curriculum**<br>

Our Music Curriculum provides Compassvalites with a vibrant and well-rounded musical experience that nurtures their creativity, expression, and appreciation for the performing arts.

###### **Instrumental Learning**
Compassvalites are introduced to a variety of instruments, including the keyboard, recorder, and ukulele. Through hands-on practice and guided instruction, they develop fundamental playing techniques, musical literacy, and ensemble skills.

###### **Singing and Movement**
Compassvalites engage in joyful singing and expressive movement as they learn to perform songs with proper vocal technique. Through dance and coordinated actions, they explore rhythm, pitch, and expression — enhancing their confidence and joy in musical performance.

Together, these experiences cultivate a joyful and well-rounded appreciation of music, encouraging Compassvalites to express themselves confidently and connect with others through the universal language of music.
