### **Learning for Life Programme**

##### **Music as a Canvas for Creativity and Collaboration**

At Compassvale Primary School, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) leverages the power of music to nurture creativity, build character, and strengthen social-emotional skills. Through varied and authentic musical experiences, Compassvalites are given opportunities to express themselves, collaborate with others, and grow in confidence.

**This programme aims to:**

* Foster Compassvalites’ creativity through musical improvisation and exploration
* Promote collaboration and teamwork by engaging Compassvalites in group music-making activities

By learning, creating, and performing together, Compassvalites not only develop musical skills but also important life skills that will support them well beyond the classroom.

##### **A Progressive and Joyful Music Learning Experience**

Our music programme is thoughtfully designed to develop Compassvalites’ musical skills progressively across the primary years, while nurturing their creativity, confidence, and appreciation for diverse musical forms.

In the lower primary levels, Compassvalites are introduced to the fundamentals of music through two engaging programmes. The Keyboard Programme helps them build a strong foundation in note reading and rhythm as they learn to play simple melodies. 

Complementing this is the Tambourine Dance Programme, where Compassvalites express themselves through movement and learn to coordinate rhythm and tempo while handling the tambourine in choreographed routines.

As they move into the middle primary years, Compassvalites expand their instrumental experience by learning the recorder, which sharpens their breath control, finger coordination, and melodic understanding. They are also introduced to ethnic percussion instruments, giving them a taste of Singapore’s rich cultural heritage while promoting ensemble playing and rhythmic sensitivity.

In the upper primary levels, Compassvalites take their musical journey further by learning to play the ukulele, exploring chord progressions and song accompaniment. They also get to express their creativity through digital music composition using GarageBand, integrating technology in music-making.

##### **Harmonising Creativity and Collaboration Through Music**

At Compassvale Primary School, we celebrate Compassvalites’ musical talents through meaningful performance opportunities that spark creativity and encourage collaboration. Compass Ignite, our signature talent showcase, provides a vibrant platform for Compassvalites to express themselves confidently—whether through singing, instrumental play, or original compositions—while also working together to put up engaging performances.

Complementing this are morning and recess busking sessions, where Compassvalites share music with their peers in informal, student-led settings. These opportunities not only spread joy and positivity across the school, but also foster a sense of teamwork, artistic expression, and peer encouragement.

Through these experiences, Compassvalites grow as confident and creative performers, while discovering how music can be a powerful tool for connection, collaboration, and building a caring school community.
