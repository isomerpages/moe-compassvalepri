##### **What We Do** <br>
The Brass Band is one of Compassvale Primary’s established performing arts groups, formed in 2003. Under the guidance of our dedicated band instructors and teachers, members learn to play brass and percussion instruments and perform as a full ensemble. Our band has showcased its talent at school events and national platforms over the years.<br>
