### **Chinese Dance**
Students are taught by qualified dance instructors and guided by our dedicated teachers. Through Chinese Dance CCA, members will improve their overall physical fitness, sense of rhythm and gracefulness. They also develop their communication and social skills as they train as a team. Members will have the opportunities to perform at school and public events. Members may also be selected to represent the school in competitions organised by external dance organisations.
