##### **What We Do**
Chinese Dance celebrates elegance, expression and storytelling through movement. Under the guidance of experienced instructors and dedicated teachers, members learn a range of traditional and contemporary Chinese dance styles. Students develop musicality, body control, rhythm and grace as they train and perform as an ensemble. <br><br>
