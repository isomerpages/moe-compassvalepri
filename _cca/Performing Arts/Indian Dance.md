##### **What We Do**<br>
Indian Dance showcases the vibrancy, rhythm and cultural richness of classical, folk and contemporary Indian dance. Members are trained in expressive hand gestures, rhythmic footwork, dynamic formations and captivating stage presence. They also explore Indian semi-classical and folk music genres that bring each performance to life.
