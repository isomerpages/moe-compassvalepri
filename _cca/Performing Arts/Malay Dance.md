The Malay dancers will be introduced to the different types of Malay dance movements. They will be equipped with the skills to dance gracefully to the tune of different Malay music. Our dance members are given opportunities to participate in various performances and competitions. At the end of the learning journey in Compassvale, we hope to instil the importance of the R3ICH values in the dance members.
