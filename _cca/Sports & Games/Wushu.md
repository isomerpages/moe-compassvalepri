### **Wushu**
In Wushu, students get to learn self-defence skills and weaponry while exhibiting team spirit and bonding. They learn  different skills and routines according to their competence and potential and train relentlessly. There are various  opportunities for students to perform during school based performances and compete in the annual National Inter-School Wushu Competition.
