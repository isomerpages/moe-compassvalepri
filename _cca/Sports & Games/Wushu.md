### **Wushu**
In Wushu, students get to learn self-defence skills and weaponry while exhibiting team spirit and bonding. They learn&nbsp; different skills and routines according to their competence and potential and train relentlessly. There are various&nbsp; opportunities for students to perform during school based performances and compete in the annual National Inter-School Wushu Competition.
