### **Track and Field**

Track and field is a sport comprising various competitive events based on running, jumping and throwing.  

Weekly, our athletes congregate to build their character, hone their techniques and foster stronger bonds. The senior athletes lead the team in warm-up routines and drills. This opportunity promotes responsible decision-making which develops their leadership qualities.

Our athletes go through various training drills to develop specific skills and overcome their weaknesses. The target for each drill is moderated regularly on an increasing and achievable basis to bring our athletes to the next level of excellence. Those who exhibit progression in skills and grit form the school team who will have the opportunity to participate in large scale competitions such as the National School Games.

In Track and Field, each child excels in his/her own forte, yet we grow as a team.
