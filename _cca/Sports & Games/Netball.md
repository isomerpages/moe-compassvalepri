In the P4 Junior team, our players undergo training where they pick up foundational skills such as agility and teamwork. After a rigorous selection process, players are selected to be a part of the junior and senior school teams.

In these teams led by our coach and teachers, they continue to sharpen their skills and develop their mental and physical resilience which enable them to excel in their game performance. The Compassvale Primary School teams have continued to shine at the North Zone Netball Championships in the past years.
