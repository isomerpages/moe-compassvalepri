### **Football**
Our school values such as Respect and Resilience are inculcated in our CCA sessions in order to equip students to enjoy the beautiful game. The boys are taught the essential physical skills such as dribbling, passing and receiving, and shooting through drills and activities. They are also introduced to positions and roles in a football game.

In Upper Primary, the boys learn game concepts such as the importance of formation and positional gameplay.Â Independent cooperative play and the building of good teamwork is facilitated through small sided games. As part of the holistic education of athletes, the importance of regular physical conditioning through physical training, nutrition and healthy sleeping patterns are highlighted.

Students who show potential are selected to represent the school at the annual zonal games. School team members continue to represent our school in the annual zonal games and organised small sided tournaments.
