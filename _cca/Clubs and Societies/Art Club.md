### **Art Club**
Art Club provides a platform for our members to express themselves with artistic processes. It allows exploration, experimentation and provides members with opportunities to develop new and existing art creation skills. Members are exposed to different art styles, artists and art movements throughout the course of art making; and through art appreciation classes, members also get to discuss and understand the value of art in their lives. Through progressive and sequential art tasks, the Art Club hopes to equip members with artistic skills and knowledge to observe and perceive the world with heightened aesthetic sensitivity and awareness.
