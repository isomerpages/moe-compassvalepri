### **Physical Science**
Science Club conducts activities to encourage students to explore science in the world around them.  We begin with kitchen science in which club members use a host of household ingredients to conduct science experiments. Through such experiments, students learn how liquid soap breaks down fat in milk, causing a swirling symphony of colours to the food colouring.  Students will also learn that baking soda and vinegar create an acid-base reaction and the two chemicals work together to create a gas. Science Club also promotes environmental consciousness through upcycling projects.  Through these projects, students minimise the volume of discarded materials and turn their trash to treasure. Students use recyclables materials such as boxes, cartons of milks, bottles and compact discs to create usable products.
