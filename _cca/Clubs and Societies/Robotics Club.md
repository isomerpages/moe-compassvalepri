Robotics Club members in Compassvale Primary School engage in the design, construction, operation and application of robots through various platforms â€“ SCRATCH, Arduino and LEGO Mindstorms. Throughout their journey in Robotics, students develop&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century competencies like critical and inventive thinking as they create new inventions or look into improving existing systems. Having mastered the various robotics systems introduced to them, students put their knowledge to the test as they innovate to&nbsp;construct and programme robots in order to solve real-life situations.
