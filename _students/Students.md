#### **Home-Based Learning Support Structure**
Our HBL curriculum structure is designed to last about four hours in total on school days, consisting of a maximum of two hours online and an average of two hours offline for an average student. Some students may require more time to complete their work while others require less.
  
Students can choose their own pace and timing to complete their offline assignments. For students who require more structure, they can follow the schedule provided.
