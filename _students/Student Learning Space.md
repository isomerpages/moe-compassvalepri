#### **<u>Frequently Asked Questions</u>**<br>
**Q1. I have forgotten my password. What should I do?** <br>
There are three ways that you can reset your password:
*   Reset via email. Please remember the email address used during your first setup. If you cannot see the email in your inbox, it may be in the spam or junk email folder.
*   Reset via answering security questions
*   Call SLS Helpdesk at 67026513

**Q2. I have forgotten my username. What should I do?** 
<br>
The format of your Username is a combination of the first 5 characters of your Name, the last 4 digits and the letter of your NRIC/FIN/BC.<br>

**Q3. My account has been locked. What should I do?**  <br>
Your account will be locked after 6 consecutive attempts to log in with an incorrect password.
<br>
1. Contact your class form teacher or subject teacher. Your teacher will inform your school's SLS administrator, who will be able to unlock your account.
2. Alternatively, please contact the SLS Helpdesk to unlock your account. You will need to answer the security questions to verify that you are the legitimate account holder.<br>
