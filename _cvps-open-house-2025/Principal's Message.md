<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>As an educator, I often asked myself, what is the purpose of education?
To me, education is strengthening one’s heart and mind so that they have
the will to act responsibility and the belief that any individual can seek
to be a better version of themselves. The school’s emblem reflects our
school’s commitment to the total development of the child through quality
education centered on values and compassion, instilling the desire for
lifelong learning and self-improvement.</p>
<p>Compassvale Primary School (CVPS) was established on 4 January 1999, our
vision inspires us to nurture Thinkers • Leaders • Champions. We want our
students to be ethical, responsible thinkers and leaders who are attuned
to the needs of the community and society, and actively championing for
a good cause for the betterment of the community and society.</p>
<p>To better prepare our students as active contributors, we aim to ignite
the students’ curiosity and passion for learning through our total curriculum
both within and beyond the classroom. Our school’s Learning for Life Programme
provides Compassvalites many opportunities to discover their talents and
interests. The Applied Learning Programme further develops students’ interest
in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Through these
holistic learning experiences, we seek to develop students’ critical and
inventive thinking, and problem-solving skills to tackle tomorrow’s challenges.</p>
<p>In CVPS, we provide not just a robust and holistic total curriculum, but
an enabling and caring school environment. One where the students feel
that their voices matter and they feel happy, challenged within a safe
and supportive environment.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”, a strong partnership
between school, stakeholders and community is therefore important to reinforce,
enrich, and deepen the students’ learning. This strong nexus of School-Home-Community
partnership will support teachers to help our students succeed in their
endeavours. I look forward to our enduring partnership to nurture our students
to become lifelong learners who strive together for a bright tomorrow.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your Partner-In-Education,</p>
<p>Mr Vincent Lee</p>
<p>Principal</p>
