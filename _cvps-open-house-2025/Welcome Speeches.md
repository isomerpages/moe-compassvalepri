the e-Open House, we believe these experiences will help you discover what
makes Compassvale Primary a nurturing and vibrant learning community. Strong
relationships form the foundation of a thriving school, and this is a wonderful
opportunity to begin or strengthen that bond.</p>

of student learning and creativity. From colourful artwork to hands-on
projects, each display reflects the curiosity, imagination and dedication
that fill our school every day.</p>
<p>We have taken great care to create a safe, supportive and inspiring environment

<p>Dear Prospective P1 Parents,</p>
<p>It is my pleasure, on behalf of the Parent Support Group, to invite you
to Compassvale Primary School’s Open House.</p>
<p>As a parent myself, I understand registering your child for Primary 1
can be both an exciting and anxious experience. Many parents I have met
have expressed similar feelings and I want to assure you that you are not
alone on this journey.</p>
<p>Every child is unique, with their own learning needs, strengths and interests.
Instead of asking, “What is a good school for my child?” I believe a more
meaningful question is, “What is the right school for my child?” For my
family, that meant choosing an environment where our children could discover
the joy of learning, feel a strong sense of belonging and grow in kindness.
We also wanted a safe and manageable daily commute. We chose Compassvale
Primary School and I am grateful that its dynamic learning culture, dedicated
educators and supportive parent community have helped my children thrive
academically while developing values that will guide them for life.</p>
<p>At Compassvale Primary, we believe that a strong partnership between parents
and the school is key to creating a vibrant, nurturing environment for
our children. The Parent Support Group works closely with the school to
co-create engaging activities, support student showcases and contribute
to a welcoming and joyful school atmosphere.</p>
<p>I warmly encourage all parents to volunteer, share your expertise, and
participate in school events. By being present and involved, we create
lasting memories for both our children and strengthen the heart of our
school community. The best gift we can offer is our engaged presence because
when we show up for our children and one another, we build a supportive
environment where every child feels seen, safe and valued.</p>
<p>As we like to say: “A parent’s involvement is the compass that guides
a child’s heart.”</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you and your family to our Open House.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Celina Teo</p>
<p>Chairperson, Parent Support Group</p>
