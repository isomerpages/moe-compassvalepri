<p>Dear Prospective P1 Parents,</p>
<p></p>
<p>On behalf of Compassvale Primary School Advisory Committee, I warmly welcome
you to our Open House.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have you with us as we open our doors and hearts to
share what makes Compassvale Primary such a special place for your child.</p>
<p>Our 2025 Open House offers meaningful opportunities for you to connect
with us. Whether you are attending in person or exploring our school through
the e-Open House, we believe these experiences will help you discover what
makes Compassvale Primary a nurturing and vibrant learning community. Strong
relationships form the foundation of a thriving school, and this is a wonderful
opportunity to begin or strengthen that bond.</p>
<p>As you walk through classrooms and hallways, you will find vibrant showcases
of student learning and creativity. From colourful artwork to hands-on
projects, each display reflects the curiosity, imagination, and dedication
that fill our school every day.</p>
<p>We have taken great care to create a safe, supportive and inspiring environment
where your child can flourish. Our classrooms are joyful spaces where discovery,
growth, and kindness are part of everyday learning as we nurture the leaders
and contributors of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Above all, we hope to bring you lasting memories with moments of joy,
pride, and excitement about the journey ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking time to learn more about Compassvale Primary School.</p>
<p>We look forward to journeying with you as we nurture your child's growth
and potential.</p>
