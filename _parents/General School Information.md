### **General School Information**
#### **1  Road Safety**
a. If you drive your child/ward to school, please comply with the following procedures:
*  Alight your child/ward at the school porch. Do not stop along Compassvale Street as you would be obstructing traffic and endangering school children crossing in front of the car park entrance as the view would be blocked. Traffic along Compassvale Street is usually heavy. As good neighbours, we would like to help keep the roads safe for everyone.
* As you drive into the school compound, drive carefully and below 15 km/h. Be prepared to stop suddenly if children wander into your path.
* Prepare your child/ward in advance so that alighting from the vehicle can be done without holding up others in the line behind you.
* Consider leaving home earlier to avoid the crowd during school peak hours as the road has limited capacity and is unable to safely accommodate a large number of vehicles arriving simultaneously.

b. If your child/ward cycles to school, we seek your cooperation in the following areas:
* Provide your child/ward with a cycling helmet and teach him/her to wear it properly.
* Teach him/her to dismount from the bicycle and push it when approaching the school gate. Signs in yellow have been installed on the fence as a reminder to all cyclists.
* Cycle slowly when approaching the traffic junctions around the school and the school gates as inconsiderate riding poses a danger to everyone using the road.  

#### **2 School Security**
a.  The safety and security of our students is a priority and we appreciate your support for our efforts to balance security and convenience. We seek your cooperation to continue to register at the security counter near Gate 3 and obtain the required security passes before proceeding to our General Office, bookshop or dental clinic. 

b.   Please note that all other areas of the school are strictly out of bounds to visitors. This includes the school canteen where the sale of food and drinks is restricted to only staff and students. 

#### **3  Temperature-Taking Exercise**
a.   To ensure a healthy environment for our students and staff, we conduct temperature monitoring for a week at the start of every term. The temperature-taking exercise aims to inculcate self-care and social responsibility.
 
b.   Please ensure that your child/ward brings along his/her Personal Health Care Kit to school. Kindly check that your child/ward’s oral digital thermometer is in working condition.
 
c.    **What Parents/Guardians Can Do**: Before your child/ward leaves for school, you should take his/her temperature and look out for any symptoms of illness. If your child/ward is unwell, we would like your cooperation to seek medical attention for your child/ward and ensure that he/she is well before returning to school. 

#### **4  Personal and Social Responsibility**
a.  **Hygiene Practices:** The school will continue to remind students to maintain a high standard of personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility, including proper washing of hands.

#### **7  School Bags**
a.  The Health Promotion Board (HPB) has advised that primary school students should only carry between 10% and 15% of their body weight. Hence, the school would like to seek your assistance to ensure that your child carries a school bag of a suitable weight. We will also implement measures, such as providing lockers and inculcating in our Compassvalites the good habit of being organised.

b.    You can help your lower primary children pack their school bags according to the daily timetable and the day’s needs. This helps to ensure that your child does not carry heavy and unnecessary accessories. You are also advised to buy school bags made of lightweight material with few compartments. The straps should be adjustable and cushioned for the comfort. Please refrain from the use of roller/trolley bags as they may be difficult for children to carry when climbing stairs. They also encourage overloading of the bags. Our Form Teachers will conduct periodic checks as part of our efforts towards lightening our Compassvalites’ school bags. 

#### **8  Communications and Coordination**
a.    We believe that regular and open communication between school and parents/guardian is important in helping us achieve our common aim of providing an excellent education for our Compassvalites. We will keep you informed of important matters through our school website [https://compassvalepri.moe.edu.sg/](https://compassvalepri.moe.edu.sg/), Parents Gateway announcements and letters. You may also email our administration at our generic email address: **cvps@moe.edu.sg.**

b.    The Student Handbook is another means for you to communicate with our teachers. You may write short notes in the Handbook and address it to the teacher concerned. Please remind your child/ward to show the teacher the note that you have written. 

c.    The operation hours for our General Office are from 0745hrs to 1700hrs from Monday to Friday. We are closed on Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays. If you wish to call our General Office, our telephone numbers are: 6388 2819 &amp; 6384 5619.
