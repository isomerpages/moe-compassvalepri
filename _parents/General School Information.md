### **General School Information**
#### **1  Road Safety**
a. If you drive your child/ward to school, please comply with the following procedures:
*  Alight your child/ward at the school porch. Do not stop along Compassvale Street as you would be obstructing traffic and endangering school children crossing in front of the car park entrance as the view would be blocked. Traffic along Compassvale Street is usually heavy. As good neighbours, we would like to help keep the roads safe for everyone.
* As you drive into the school compound, drive carefully and below 15 km/h. Be prepared to stop suddenly if children wander into your path.
* Prepare your child/ward in advance so that alighting from the vehicle can be done without holding up others in the line behind you.
* Consider leaving home earlier to avoid the crowd during school peak hours as the road has limited capacity and is unable to safely accommodate a large number of vehicles arriving simultaneously.

b. If your child/ward cycles to school, we seek your cooperation in the following areas:
* Provide your child/ward with a cycling helmet and teach him/her to wear it properly.
* Teach him/her to dismount from the bicycle and push it when approaching the school gate. Signs in yellow have been installed on the fence as a reminder to all cyclists.
* Cycle slowly when approaching the traffic junctions around the school and the school gates as inconsiderate riding poses a danger to everyone using the road.  

#### **2 School Security**
a.  The safety and security of our students is a priority and we appreciate your support for our efforts to balance security and convenience. We seek your cooperation to continue to register at the security counter near Gate 3 and obtain the required security passes before proceeding to our General Office, bookshop or dental clinic. 

b.   Please note that all other areas of the school are strictly out of bounds to visitors. This includes the school canteen where the sale of food and drinks is restricted to only staff and students. 

#### **3  Temperature-Taking Exercise**
a.   To ensure a healthy environment for our students and staff, we conduct temperature monitoring for a week at the start of every term. The temperature-taking exercise aims to inculcate self-care and social responsibility.
 
b.   Please ensure that your child/ward brings along his/her Personal Health Care Kit to school. Kindly check that your child/ward’s oral digital thermometer is in working condition.
 
c.    **What Parents/Guardians Can Do**: Before your child/ward leaves for school, you should take his/her temperature and look out for any symptoms of illness. If your child/ward is unwell, we would like your cooperation to seek medical attention for your child/ward and ensure that he/she is well before returning to school. 

#### **4  Personal and Social Responsibility**
a.  **Hygiene Practices:** The school will continue to remind students to maintain a high standard of personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility, including proper washing of hands.
 
b.   **What Parents/Guardians Can Do:** Teach your child/ward the properly way to wash their hands. Check that their uniforms are washed and changed daily.

#### **7  School Bags**
a.	The general guideline from Health Promotion Board (HPB) is for children to carry no more than 15 per cent of their bodyweight. In practice, that would generally mean no more than 5kg depending on the child’s weight in the first few years of school. Hence, the school would like to seek your assistance to ensure that your child carries a school bag of a suitable weight. For the well-being of our Compassvalites, alongside providing lockers, we will continue to instill good organisational habits:
* Students to pack their bags in accordance with the daily class timetable. 
* Students can use the lockers to keep some of their heavier books or items which they need daily in school. A number lock is recommended to secure the locker.

b. We would like to recommend that the school bags are made of lightweight material.

c. Please refrain from the use of roller/trolley bags as they can be challenging for children to carry when climbing stairs and may also encourage overpacking. 

#### **8  Communications Guidelines**
a. We believe that regular and open communication between school and parents/guardian is important in helping us achieve our common aim of providing an excellent education for our Compassvalites. However, teachers are not required to share personal mobile numbers or communicate via other social media/ communication platforms beyond the official modes of communication.
<br>

**<u>Modes of Communication</u>**<br>
We will keep you informed of important matters through Parents Gateway announcements and letters, and our school website [**https://compassvalepri.moe.edu.sg/**](https://compassvalepri.moe.edu.sg/). You may also email our administration at our generic email address: [**cvps@moe.edu.sg**](cvps@moe.edu.sg). You may also email directly to the relevant key personnel or Form Teachers using the email addresses provided on our school website.

The Student Handbook is another means for you to communicate with our teachers. You may write short notes in the Student Handbook and address them to the teacher concerned. Please remind your child/ward to show the teacher the note that you have written.

We strongly encourage you to make an appointment with the school staff if you would like to meet them personally. The operation hours for our General Office are from 0745hrs to 1700hrs from Mondays to Fridays. We are closed on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. If you wish to call our General Office, our telephone number is **6388 2819**. To schedule a meeting, please email the school personnel at least three working days in advance to minimise disruption to their core duties such as their teaching duties.

**<u>Expected Response Time</u>**<br>
In line with Civil Service standards, parents/ guardians can expect responses within:<br>

-	Three working days for simple queries.<br>
-	Seven working days for queries requiring some investigation.<br>
-	Twenty-one working days for complex queries that require extensive triangulation of information from various parties involved.

**<u>Communication Hours</u>**<br>
Parents are encouraged to contact teachers during school hours (refer to point 5 above) and during term time. Our teachers are not expected to respond to queries outside these hours, on weekends, and during school holidays.

**<u>Respectful Communication</u>**<br>

-	Our staff are committed to partnering parents/ guardians with sincerity, integrity, and professionalism. We encourage open and respectful dialogue to support students’ well-being and learning.
-	By showing mutual courtesy and respect, we set a positive example for our children. The school will disengage from any communication that is rude, disrespectful, or abusive towards staff.
-	MOE values our staff and will take firm action to protect them against unreasonable behavior, harassment, or abuse.

b.    We actively manage the school calendar on our webpage so that you can plan ahead to coordinate with our schedule of activities.
