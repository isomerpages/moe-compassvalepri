### **Parents Gateway Mobile App**
#### **About the Parents Gateway Mobile App**
The Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with school more conveniently on administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on the school's programmes and activities.  

The PG App has been implemented in all schools over the course of 2019. If you have two or more children and they are in different schools, you will still be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same PG App.
