<p><strong>Dear Parents and Guardians,</strong>
</p>
<p>As an educator, I often reflect on the purpose of education. I believe
education shapes both the heart and mind, empowering individuals to act
responsibly, strive to become better versions of themselves, and enable
them to make meaningful contributions to society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, education at Compassvale Primary School (CVPS) seeks to nurture
every child to grow in his/her character, intellect and purpose so that
they become purpose-driven learners who can thrive with confidence in an
ever evolving and complex future.</p>
<p>Our vision of nurturing Thinkers of Tomorrow, Leaders of Character, and
Contributors of Community (T.L.C.) shapes the CVPS experience. As Thinkers
of Tomorrow, our students are encouraged to be curious, creative, and resilient
problem-solvers who embrace challenges and innovate with confidence. As
Leaders of Character, they develop strong values, moral courage, and the
ability to collaborate, influence, and lead with empathy. As Contributors
of Community, they learn to exercise student agency, care for others, and
develop a deep sense of belonging and responsibility to the community.</p>
<p>Through a progressive and holistic total curriculum, we provide authentic
and experiential learning opportunities that extend beyond the classroom.
Our Learning for Life Programme, Applied Learning Programme, W.O.R.L.D.
overseas learning trips, Camps and Co-Curriculum Activities enable our
students to broaden their perspectives, discover their strengths and interests,
apply their learning meaningfully, develop skills and character strengths
that are essential for the future.</p>
<p>Beyond the curriculum, at the heart of CVPS, is a caring and enabling
culture where relationships matter. We strive to create a safe and supportive
environment where students and staff feel confident expressing their voices,
taking ownership of their continuous growth.</p>
<p>Lastly, education is a shared endeavour, by strengthening the School-Home-Community
collaboration, I believe we can collectively support our students’ holistic
development and well-being. I look forward to working closely with you,
parents, to nurture Compassvalites to become lifelong learners who lead
with purpose, serve with compassion, and embrace the future with optimism.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<p><strong>Your Partner-in-Education,</strong>
<br><strong>Mr Vincent Lee</strong>
<br><strong>Principal</strong>
