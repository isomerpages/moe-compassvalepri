### **Our History**
Compassvale Primary School was established on 4 January 1999 at a holding site in Sengkang Primary School.

In January 2000, Compassvale Primary School shifted temporarily to a second holding site in Rivervale Primary School as the school building was still under construction. The school moved into its present premises on 13 November 2000. It was officially opened on 21 October 2001.

The school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) for Aesthetics and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Robotics. The school commenced an on-site upgrading exercise in June 2011 which was completed in December 2012. The school has operated as a single session since January 2013.

In 2019, the school will be celebrating its 20thÂ anniversary as it continues to serve the Sengkang Community.
