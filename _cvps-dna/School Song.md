### **School Song**
We the pupils of Compassvale Primary<br>
Striving for a bright tomorrow.<br>
We all share one vision<br>
And our mission is<br>
To succeed in every way.
  

Chorus:<br>
United in a spirit of learning<br>
We seek to do our best.<br>
Compassionate, responsible<br>
And loyal we will be.
