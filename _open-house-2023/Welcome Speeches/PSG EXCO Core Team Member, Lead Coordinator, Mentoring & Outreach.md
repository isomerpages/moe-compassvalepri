Dearest Prospective Parents, <br>

In line with our school’s theme for Open House 2023 which is “The Compassvale Experience”, I would like to share my experience in Compassvale Primary School as a parent thus far. Indeed, parenting is not easy, especially raising a child in this increasingly complex world. The presence of a supportive community has made a difference in helping me navigate through the ups and downs in my parenting journey. There’s a saying - it takes a village to raise a child. Who is this village? They are the school leaders, teachers and parents of my children’s classmates and schoolmates who play a significant role in my children’s holistic well-being and development. Personally, I strongly believe in home-school partnership. Looking back, maintaining an open conversation with teachers has given me much assurance that my child is adapting well especially when it was nerve-wrecking, at least for myself when my child entered Primary 1. <br>

I appreciate the close partnership between school and PSG to better support parents and our children’s well-being, where parenting talks as well as parent-child bonding activities are organised regularly to strengthen positive parent-child relationship. One of the ongoing initiatives started in February 2023 in CVPS, is the “Let Us Chat!” program, organised by The National Advisory Council, COMPASS (COMmunity and Parents in Support of Schools) which aims to support parents in building good relationships with their children and enhancing their children's overall mental well-being. I am grateful to have this privilege to be trained as one of the facilitators as part of PSG to conduct these monthly sessions with P4 to P6 Compassvalites and their parents. From those sessions, I have learnt the importance of developing a growth mindset and learning-focused posture instead of competition-focused, in myself as a parent first and then in a better position to influence my child likewise so that he/she can build their self-confidence and motivation towards learning in school, with a more positive perspective towards education. I’m truly amazed at my own mindset shift towards the purpose of education, not only to develop hard skills but also soft skills such as leadership, problem-solving, decision-making, negotiation, conflict resolution and communication skills that are very crucial throughout our children’s lives.

Being a parent volunteer with PSG, I am also aware of the volunteering opportunities for school events such as learning journeys, festive celebrations and  etc., which have created common topics for me and my children to talk about, helping to build our parent-child relationship positively.  Having them to know that I’m actively involved and willing to be part of their primary school journey as much as I can despite being a working mother, gives them the assurance they needed to thrive in school and in life. 

Looking forward to connect with you, to journey together as fellow parents and to make a difference in this parenting community as well as our children’s lives. 

Warmest regards, <br>
