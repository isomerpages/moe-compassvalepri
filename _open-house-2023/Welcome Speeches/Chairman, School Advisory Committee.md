**Dear Prospective P1 Parents,** <br>

As I look back at the past CVPS Open House themes, I feel a sense of gratefulness and appreciation throughout all these years of journeying with the school that my children who are now working adults have graduated from.  It is so apt to have this year’s Open House theme “The Compassvale Experience”, where we would like you to also experience that personal engagement with the enthusiastic school staff and the synergy of the students through their presentations and performances.  
<br>
My CVPS experience and memories were formed and forged from the interactions with the school leaders, teachers, support staff and students throughout the years.  Likewise as parents, you and your child will soon start your journey together through similar engagements.  The experiences from your Journey together Connecting We, You, I and Us will unite us as one family, one Home. That is your special Compassvale Experience. <br>

From all the years of experience with CVPS, I am assured of the holistic education the school offers, where it is the people that make the difference.  I too wanted to play a small part and chose to give back through serving the School Advisory Committee (SAC).  I am confident that one day, you will also have the heart to give back in your own special way. You and your child will experience the CVPS warmth and  care, where we work together to nurture students into compassionate leaders to excel in service to the greater community!
On behalf of the SAC, we look forward to your participation at the Open House!  

Warmest regards, <br>
Mr Jamie Chen <br>
Chair of the School Advisory Committee
