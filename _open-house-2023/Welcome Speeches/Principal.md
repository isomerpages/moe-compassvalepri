Dear Visitor,<br>
Welcome to the Compassvale Primary School website.

**If you are a prospective P1 parent,** we thank you for the opportunity to present our school to you online. As you browse through our website, we hope you would be able to get an idea of what the CVPS experience is. We would also like to suggest that you browse through Our [FaceBook Page](https://www.facebook.com/compassvalepri/)  for more information though posts that feature our staff and students.

We usually hold an Open House on a Saturday in July for members of the public to visit the school and I would like to invite you to our next one. Should you visit us then, you would be able to walk through our lush gardens, explore our facilities and look at our exhibits to see how we bring lessons to life for young children. Your pre-school child would have an opportunity to participate in one of our demonstration lessons while you watch from the back of the classroom or you could chat with one of our teachers or PSG members. After completing our trail card at the end of the visit, you can claim a goodie bag of school souvenirs as a memento of the experience.  

In Compassvale Primary, we believe in understanding the immediate needs of the child, appreciating the needs for the future and then meeting those needs through our professional knowledge about learning. For example, our lush gardens are part of our desire to bring nature to our children so that they can experience the lessons that real life brings. The completion of the trail card during the Open House is a form of gamification - a way to motivate the completion of a task. Our insistence on encouraging our students to mix with others from different backgrounds stems from our anticipation that as they grow as digital natives, it can also lead to thinking in digital silos. As educators, we wish to do our part to encourage our young to appreciate the diversity of perspectives for a harmonious society.

There are many good primary schools in the Sengkang/ Punggol area and each has its own signature. The schools in the network complement one another to serve the Sengkang/ Punggol communities by providing choices for parents so that they can find the best fit for their children. We hope you will find one that will provide an experience that is best suited to your childâ€™s inclinations. Should we have the privilege of being that match, we look forward to meeting you at our P1 Orientation.

Best,<br>
Jeffrey Aw<br>
Principal
